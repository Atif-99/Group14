Talk though together going thought the functional specification, Brandon haven't responded to any emails as of yet and wasn't at the meeting. 
Decided on the next meeting for Thursday at 14:00. 
Tasks to continue to learn UML and think of possible extra features. 
We also decided to use draw.io for all the UML diagrams as it was the software that most people have used before. 
We then talked about the issue with lectures microphones.
